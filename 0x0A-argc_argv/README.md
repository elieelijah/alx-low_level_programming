0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to : A program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
    - If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again.
    - You should not remove the path before the name of the program.
    - Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-whatsmyname.c -o mynameis`

1. Silence is argument carried out by other means : A program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
    - Your program should print a number, followed by a new line.
    - Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 1-args.c -o nargs`

2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter : A program that prints all the arguments it receives.
    - All arguments should be printed, including the first one.
    - Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line.
    - Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 2-args.c -o args`

3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument : A program that multiplies two numbers.
    - Your program should print the result of the `multiplication`, followed by a new line.
    - You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer.
    - If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1.
    - Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 3-mul.c -o mul`

4. To infinity and beyond : A program that adds positive numbers.
    - Print the result, followed by a new line.
    - If no number is passed to the program, `print 0`, followed by a new line.
    - If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, `print Error`, followed by a new line, and `return 1`.
    - You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an `int`.
    - Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 4-add.c -o add`

5. Minimal Number of Coins for Change : A program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.
    * Usage: ./change cents
    * Where cents is the amount of cents you need to give back.
    * if the number of arguments passed to your program is not exactly 1, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1.
    * You should use atoi to parse the parameter passed to your program.
    * If the number passed as the argument is negative, print 0, followed by a new line.
    * You can use an unlimited number of coins of values 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent.
    * Compile the code this way: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 100-change.c -o change
